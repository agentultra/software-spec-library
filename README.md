# Software Specification Library

An open library of software specifications. This repository aims to
collect open-source specifications of common software systems and
components. It is intended to be a starting point for learning about
and using mathematical models of software systems as specifications.
It is similar in scope to *Design Patterns* while also serving as a
recipe database for your own designs.
